MultiSpec - Windows Version (machine running Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/Vista/7 required)

Download package contains:

(a) This transmittal information. 
    
(b) a copy of the latest MultiSpec - Windows Version (MultiSpecW32.exe)

(c) a Microsoft Word document labeled MultiSpec_Description.doc which provides
     a brief summary of MultiSpec functional capabilities.
    
(d) a small Thematic Mapper data set labeled Tipjul1.tif.
    
(e) a sample GIS file in the form of a ground truth map of the TM data 
     area, labeled jtipsub1.gis, and one with the suffix .trl, which 
     contains information used by the program such as color palette 
     information.

(f) a sample ArcView shape file labeled troads.shp.

(g) A folder titled epsg_csv with files needed by the GDAL library used by MultiSpec
     to interpret projection information in the headers of some file types. 
     Keep this folder with the MultiSpec application exe file for these files to be read.

A document entitled 'An Introduction and Reference for MultiSpec' is the primary 
documentation for the program. This document can be downloaded separately 
from the web in Acrobat PDF format. It contains (a) a brief 
background statement, (b) a simple tutorial which uses the TM data set provided, 
(c) a section entitled Using MultiSpec, describing how to import data into the 
system and further illustrations of how a larger set of MultiSpec capabilities might be 
used, (d) a Reference section providing details on each item in each program 
menu, and (e) three appendices.

The Introduction to MultiSpec was developed for the Macintosh version. 
Therefore some of the figures may appear somewhat different that what is 
displayed on a Windows machine. Also not all of the capabilities listed in the 
'Intro' are available in the Windows version.

It is recommended that new users follow through on a computer the steps 
described in the Tutorial Example and Using MultiSpec sections. After doing 
this, the Reference section should be read, as there are a number of features 
and capabilities in the program which may not be apparent at first glance.

This Win32 version of the program is intended for machines running Windows
95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7. 
It should run on a machine with as little 
as 8M of memory, but it will run more conveniently with more.

Our goal with regard to the program is to have a general capability to 
manipulate multispectral and hyperspectral data available for use in our own 
research effort and to illustrate the results of our research efforts. In 
order to limit the magnitude of our software effort, it has been our policy to 
rely upon commercially available software, such as word processors, 
spreadsheets, and graphing programs, wherever possible, rather than to write 
software for such functions directly in the system. As a result, the program 
is written in such a way as to make it convenient to copy and paste or 
otherwise export images, tabular data, and text into such commercial 
application programs. 

We have no plans to make a commercial product of MultiSpec at this time. 
Rather, we expect to share it freely with colleagues in the research and 
educational community as they may desire, on an "as is" basis. Basically our 
intent is to have a program directed primarily at multispectral and 
hyperspectral data which is easy to learn and use, even for the first time or 
occasional user, and which is implemented on an adequately powerful processor 
inexpensive enough for individuals to afford.

The program has been only moderately well tested and debugged, and so we ask 
that you limit your expectations of it accordingly. We have used it in our 
research and with our students in our graduate remote sensing course, but not 
in a wide variety of other environments. In addition, there are over 1200 
known registered users of MultiSpec around the world. Please let us know if 
you have trouble with it. We would also appreciate having your comments and 
criticisms of it after you have had an opportunity to use it, as this will be 
valuable in improving it further. Please note that the program and its 
documentation is copyrighted. We ask that you not supply copies of the program 
to others, but rather, refer them to us so that an accurate list of registered 
recipients of MultiSpec can be maintained.

We are currently maintaining significant additional documentation about the 
theory and application of MultiSpec and also update information for MultiSpec
