# Preface
This course is **GST101 Introduction to Geospatial Technology** and was written by original authors [Kurt Menke](https://twitter.com/geomenke) and [Rick Smith](https://github.com/RickSmith)
 for [**QGIS 2.8**](https://www.qgis.org) software. I have updated this current version to [**QGIS 3.4.x Long term release**](https://www.qgis.org) software. 
 This course consists of 7 labs and introduction to FOSS and FOSS4G movement. 

## Course Topics

## FOSS4G Curriculum
FOSS4G curriculum was originally designed by [Kurt Menke](https://twitter.com/geomenke) and [Rick Smith](https://github.com/RickSmith). 
Their main idea was to design a curriculum for training and education in geospatial domain using free and open source software (FOSS). 
Some how their highly valuable contents were not updated for last 5 years, so I decided to update them with latest versions of 
FOSS. Their curriculum consists of five courses as following

1. GST 101 - Introduction to Geospatial Technology
2. GST 102 - Spatial Analysis
3. GST 103 - Introduction to Remote Sensing 
4. GST 104 - Cartographic Design 
5. GST 105 - Introduction to Remote Sensing
