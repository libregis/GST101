# Preface
This course is **GST101: Introduction to Geospatial Technology** and was written by original authors [Kurt Menke](https://twitter.com/geomenke) and [Rick Smith](https://github.com/RickSmith)
 for [**QGIS 2.8**](https://www.qgis.org) software. At [LibreGIS](https://github.com/libregis), we have updated this current [**QGIS 3.4.x Long term release**](https://www.qgis.org) software. 
 
## Course Topics
 This course consists of following seven labs and each lab consists of several task. Students are required to go step by step and follow the instruction given under each task. 
 For this series of labs, we will explain how to open and use QGIS using the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system.

* [Lab 1 - Spatial Data Models](Lab1.md)
* [Lab 2 - Understanding Coordinate Systems and Map Projections](Lab2.md)
* [Lab 3 - Displaying Geospatial Data](Lab3.md)
* [Lab 4 - Creating Geospatial Data](Lab4.md)
* [Lab 5 - Understanding Remote Sensing and Analysis](Lab5.md)
* [Lab 6 - Basic Geospatial Analysis Techniques](Lab6.md)

## Data Sets
All labs include necessary datasets to finish individual tasks, and can be obtained by cloning/downloading [this repository on github](https://github.com/libregis/GST101).
After extraction, you will find data sets under `Data\Lab2\...`).

## FOSS4G Curriculum
FOSS4G curriculum was originally designed by [Kurt Menke](https://twitter.com/geomenke) and [Rick Smith](https://github.com/RickSmith). 
Their main idea was to design a curriculum for training and education in geospatial domain using free and open source software (FOSS). 
Some how their highly valuable contents were not updated for last 5 years, so I decided to update them with latest versions of 
FOSS. Their curriculum consists of five courses as following

1. GST 101 - Introduction to Geospatial Technology
2. GST 102 - Spatial Analysis
3. GST 103 - Introduction to Remote Sensing 
4. GST 104 - Cartographic Design 
5. GST 105 - Introduction to Remote Sensing
